# Base Rules

- Use Reanimated v4 for all animations
- `runOnJS` and `runOnUI` are deprecated. Use `scheduleOnRN` and `scheduleOnUI` instead. Refer to `.cursor/skills/animation-with-worklets/SKILL.md` for more details.
- Always prefer Tailwind classes over StyleSheet.create when possible
- Project uses React Compiler. Prefer shared.get() / shared.set() over shared.value in app code. Refer to `.cursor/skills/animation-with-react-compiler/SKILL.md` for more details.
- Name all files in kebab-case
- Always refer to README.md for project structure on adding new files
