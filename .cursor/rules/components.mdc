# Component Function Style

## Use Function Expressions Instead of Function Declarations

All components must be defined using function expressions (arrow functions) instead of function declarations.

**Don't do this:**

```tsx
function Component() {
  return <View />;
}
```

**Instead, do this:**

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  return <View />;
};
```

This applies to all component definitions, including exported components:

**Don't do this:**

```tsx
export function Component() {
  return <View />;
}
```

**Instead, do this:**

```tsx
export const Component = () => {
  return <View />;
};
```

# Component Constants

## Naming Convention

All constants in components must be named in UPPERCASE (using SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE).

**Don't do this:**

```tsx
const fadeIn = FadeIn.duration(300);
const maxItems = 10;
```

**Instead, do this:**

```tsx
const FADE_IN = FadeIn.duration(300);
const MAX_ITEMS = 10;
```

## Placement

Constants must be placed immediately after imports and before any other code in the component.

**Don't do this:**

```tsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { FadeIn } from "react-native-reanimated";

const Component = () => {
  const FADE_IN = FadeIn.duration(300);
  // ... rest of component
};
```

**Instead, do this:**

```tsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { FadeIn } from "react-native-reanimated";

const FADE_IN = FadeIn.duration(300);

const Component = () => {
  // ... rest of component
};
```

Constants should be defined at the module level (outside the component function) when they don't depend on component props or state. If a constant needs to be inside the component (e.g., depends on props), it should still be placed at the top of the component body, right after any hooks that might be needed for its calculation.
