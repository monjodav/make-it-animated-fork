# Animation with React Compiler

## Use get() and set() Methods Instead of .value

When working with the React Compiler (this project is using React Compiler), you should refrain from accessing and modifying the `value` property directly. Instead, use the `get()` and `set()` methods. They're the alternative API for `useSharedValue`, compliant with the React Compiler standards.

```tsx
function App() {
  const sv = useSharedValue(100);

  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    "worklet";
    return { width: sv.get() * 100 };
  });

  const handlePress = () => {
    sv.set((value) => value + 1);
  };
}
```
