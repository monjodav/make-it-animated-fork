# Worklet Scheduling

## Use scheduleOnRN and scheduleOnUI Instead of runOnJS and runOnUI

Use `scheduleOnRN` and `scheduleOnUI` from `react-native-worklets` instead of `runOnJS` and `runOnUI` from `react-native-reanimated`.

**Don't do this:**

```tsx
import { runOnJS, runOnUI } from "react-native-reanimated";
```

**Instead, do this:**

```tsx
import { scheduleOnRN, scheduleOnUI } from "react-native-worklets";
```

## Use scheduleOnUI for UI Thread Functions

When scheduling functions to run on the UI thread, use `scheduleOnUI` instead of calling worklet functions directly or using `runOnUI`. The function should still include the `"worklet"` directive.

**Don't do this:**

```tsx
import { runOnUI } from "react-native-reanimated";

const myFunction = () => {
  "worklet";
  console.log("Hello from the UI Runtime!");
};

runOnUI(myFunction)();
```

**Instead, do this:**

```tsx
import { scheduleOnUI } from "react-native-worklets";

const myFunction = (): void => {
  console.log("Hello from the UI Runtime!");
};

scheduleOnUI(myFunction);
```
