# sandbox

Set SANDBOX to `true` in `src/shared/lib/constants/dev.ts`.

## Steps

1. Read `src/shared/lib/constants/dev.ts` to check the current value of `SANDBOX`.

2. Update the `SANDBOX` constant to `true`:
   - Find the line: `export const SANDBOX = false;`
   - Replace it with: `export const SANDBOX = true;`

3. Verify the change was applied correctly by reading the file and confirming `SANDBOX = true`.

4. Reload the dev server if it is running to apply the changes.
