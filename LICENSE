Make It Animated License Agreement

TL;DR;

Personal License: Build unlimited projects as an individual, but keep the code private and don't share it.

---

By accessing, downloading, or using the Make It Animated React Native animation library and code repository (the "Product"), you ("Licensee" or "you") agree to be bound by the terms of this License Agreement ("Agreement"). If you do not agree with these terms, you are prohibited from using the Product.

1. What You Can Do

Under this Personal License, Make It Animated grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

- Use the animation library and code in unlimited personal or commercial projects
- Build and deploy applications incorporating the animations
- Integrate the animation components into your own applications

This license is personal to you and cannot be shared, transferred, or sublicensed to others.

2. What You Cannot Do

You are strictly prohibited from:

- Sharing, distributing, or providing access to any part of the code repository to third parties
- Publishing, posting, or making any code publicly available (including on GitHub, public repositories, forums, or any online platform)
- Selling, reselling, or redistributing the Product as a standalone offering
- Using the Product in violation of any applicable laws or regulations
- Using the Product for unauthorized advertising, spam, or data harvesting
- Infringing upon the privacy or intellectual property rights of third parties
- Renting, leasing, or otherwise transferring your license rights

3. Modifications and Support

If you modify the original Make It Animated code, we cannot guarantee that it will continue to work correctly. Modified code is not supported, and we are not responsible for any issues that arise from changes you make.

4. Who Owns What

All intellectual property rights in the Make It Animated Product remain with Make It Animated. This includes copyrights, trademarks, and any other proprietary rights. You are granted permission to use the Product under the terms of this Agreement, but you do not acquire any ownership rights.

You may download one copy of the materials for your personal use. This is a license grant, not a transfer of ownership. If you violate any terms of this Agreement, your license will be automatically terminated, and we may revoke your access at any time.

5. Refund Policy

Due to the digital nature of our Product and the immediate access granted to protected code repositories, all sales are final. We cannot offer refunds or exchanges under any circumstances. By purchasing access, you acknowledge that the transaction is complete once access is granted.

This policy protects our intellectual property and prevents unauthorized distribution. If you experience technical difficulties or need help with the Product, please reach out to our support team at hello@makeitanimated.dev—we're here to help ensure you have a smooth experience.

6. No Warranties

The Product is provided "as is" without any warranties, whether express or implied. We make no guarantees about:

- The Product's merchantability or fitness for your particular purpose
- The accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the materials
- The stability or functionality of any code you modify
- Non-infringement of third-party rights

The materials are provided for general informational purposes only. We do not warrant or represent that using the Product will produce specific results or that it will meet your requirements.

7. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Make It Animated and its suppliers will not be liable for any damages arising from your use or inability to use the Product. This includes:

- Direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
- Loss of profits, revenue, business, or goodwill
- Loss of data or corruption of information
- Loss of opportunities or savings
- Any other financial or reputational harm

This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow these limitations, so they may not apply to you.

8. Termination

We reserve the right to immediately terminate your license and access to the Product if you breach any terms of this Agreement. This is especially true if you share, distribute, or publicly post any code. Upon termination, you must stop using the Product and delete any copies in your possession.

9. Severability

If any part of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue to be valid and enforceable. The invalid portion will be removed to the minimum extent necessary.

10. Complete Agreement

This Agreement represents the complete understanding between you and Make It Animated regarding the Product. It supersedes any prior agreements, discussions, or representations about the subject matter.
